Project Description:

I have completed a healthcare project focused on predicting the risk of a heart attack based on various factors using the CEP 1 Dataset.

Preliminary Analysis:

Performed data inspection to understand the structure of the data, identified missing values, duplicates, etc.
Removed duplicates (if any) and handled missing values using an appropriate strategy.

Data Distribution Report:

Conducted a preliminary statistical summary of the data, exploring measures of central tendencies and data spread.
Identified categorical variables and described and explored them using tools like count plots.
Studied the occurrence of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) across the Age category.
Analyzed the composition of all patients with respect to the Sex category.
Investigated the possibility of detecting heart attacks based on anomalies in resting blood pressure (trestbps).
Described the relationship between cholesterol levels and the target variable (heart attack).
Explored the relationship between peak exercising and the occurrence of a heart attack.
Checked if thalassemia is a major cause of CVD.
Identified other factors that determine the occurrence of CVD.
Used a pair plot to understand the relationships between all the given variables.

Baseline Model Building:

Built a baseline model to predict the risk of a heart attack using logistic regression and random forest algorithms.
Explored the results using correlation analysis and logistic regression for feature selection.
Leveraged standard error and p-values from statsmodels to assess the significance of features.

By completing this project, I gained valuable experience in data analysis, statistical exploration, and machine learning techniques for predicting cardiovascular disease. The project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, handle data preprocessing challenges, and build predictive models to solve practical problems.
