- Project Description:

I have completed a healthcare project focused on predicting the risk of a heart attack based on various factors using the CEP 1 Dataset.

- Preliminary Analysis:

Performed data inspection to understand the structure of the data, identified missing values, duplicates, etc.
Removed duplicates (if any) and handled missing values using an appropriate strategy.

- Data Distribution Report:

Conducted a preliminary statistical summary of the data, exploring measures of central tendencies and data spread.
Identified categorical variables and described and explored them using tools like count plots.
Studied the occurrence of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) across the Age category.
Analyzed the composition of all patients with respect to the Sex category.
Investigated the possibility of detecting heart attacks based on anomalies in resting blood pressure (trestbps).
Described the relationship between cholesterol levels and the target variable (heart attack).
Explored the relationship between peak exercising and the occurrence of a heart attack.
Checked if thalassemia is a major cause of CVD.
Identified other factors that determine the occurrence of CVD.
Used a pair plot to understand the relationships between all the given variables.

- Baseline Model Building:

Built a baseline model to predict the risk of a heart attack using logistic regression and random forest algorithms.
Explored the results using correlation analysis and logistic regression for feature selection.
Leveraged standard error and p-values from statsmodels to assess the significance of features.

By completing this project, I gained valuable experience in data analysis, statistical exploration, and machine learning techniques for predicting cardiovascular disease. The project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, handle data preprocessing challenges, and build predictive models to solve practical problems.

- 2. [Telecom Churning].(https://github.com/EkeshwarSahu/data-science/blob/main/ML%20Projects/TelecomChurning.ipynb)

- Customer Retention Modelling and Strategy for Telecom Sector.
- Performed feature engineering to determine the most important features affecting the churn rate. 
- Analyzed the correlation between different metrics. 
- Determined feature importance using tree-based models.

- 3. [Customer Service Requests Analysis].(https://github.com/EkeshwarSahu/data-science/blob/main/ML%20Projects/Customer_Service_Requests_Analysis.ipynb)

   
- Project Description
This data analysis project focuses on analyzing service request (311) calls from New York City. The main objective is to gain insights into the complaints received and understand their patterns. We have performed data wrangling techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. The project involves basic data exploratory analysis and visualization to identify major types of complaints and their distribution across different cities.

- Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is available in the 311_Service_Requests_from_2010_to_Present.csv file, which can be downloaded 


- Steps Performed
Understanding the Dataset:

Identified the shape of the dataset.
Identified variables with null values and performed missing value treatment.
Data Exploratory Analysis:

Analyzed the date column and removed entries with an incorrect timeline.
Drew a frequency plot to visualize city-wise complaints.
Drew scatter and hexbin plots to observe complaint concentration across Brooklyn.
Major Types of Complaints:

Plotted a bar graph of count vs. complaint types.
Identified the top 10 types of complaints.
Displayed the types of complaints in each city in a separate dataset.
Visualization of Major Complaint Types:

Presented visualizations of the major types of complaints in each city.
Average Response Time:

Checked the average response time across various types of complaints.
Optional: Statistical Analysis:

Identified significant variables using p-values and chi-square values.
